# Python GUI Project: Calculator

## Overview

Graphical User Interface also known as GUI(pronounced as gee-uu-eye) is a visual representation of interactive components of a computer program. 
GUI enables non-programmers to easily interact with computer programs with the use of interactive visual components such as buttons, toolbars, menus, textboxes, etc.

This GUI project aims at creating an easy to use calculator graphical user interface that is used to evaluate arithmetic expressions.
The GUI consists of:
  * a root window container that holds all other GUI widgets/components.
  * An entry/textbox where users type arithmetic expressions to be evaluated.
  * Buttons to input several values into textbox when clicked and a button to get solution-to the arithmetic expression typed in the textbox-when clicked.
 
## Getting started

Requires any version of Python. All the packages used in the [source code](/main.py) are python built-ins, so 3rd Party Packages/Libraries are not required.

Clone this repository unto your local device or just download the raw [main.py](/main.py).

Run [main.py](/main.py) and this should automatically create the GUI window. 

Non-programmers can download the executable [here](https://github.com/tomiwa-adesanya/python-calculator-gui/raw/master/Data/dist/calculator.exe)
and run the program without having python installed on your computer. The executable runs directly without installation requirements. Double click on executable and run program.

GUI Shortcuts:
  * `Ctrl+W` to close GUI window.
  * `Backspace` to delete last value typed in the textbox.
  * `Ctrl+Alt+Backspace` to clear textbox inputs.
  * `Enter` to evaluate arithmetic equation.
